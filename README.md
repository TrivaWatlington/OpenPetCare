 #🐾 OpenPetCare

OpenPetCare is an open-source, FHIR-compliant health record system for pets, designed to empower veterinary clinics, shelters, and pet owners — especially in low-resource settings.


#🌍 Vision

To provide a free, easy-to-use, standards-based platform that helps manage pet health records digitally and securely across communities worldwide.


#🔧 Key Features (Planned)

- 🧬 FHIR-compatible data structure (Patient, Immunization, Condition, Observation)
- 🧾 Health timeline for pets
- 📱 QR code sharing of pet health profiles
- 📶 Offline-first PWA experience for mobile use
- 🔒 Role-based access for vets, owners, and shelter managers


#🧱 Tech Stack (Planned)

- Frontend: React.js + Tailwind CSS
- Backend: Django REST Framework or Node.js
- Database: PostgreSQL
- APIs: HL7 FHIR API integration
- DevOps: Docker + GitHub Actions
- Auth: OAuth2 or Firebase


#🎯 GSoC 2025 Focus

This repository supports my GSoC 2025 application to OpenMRS. The proposal explores building OpenPetCare either as:
- A standalone FHIR-based health record platform for pets,
- Or an extension/module within the OpenMRS ecosystem.


#✏️ Mockups and Diagrams

> _Coming soon_ — Will include Figma wireframes and database architecture.
